            Using my encryption tool is easy! Just type the string that you want
            to encrypt into the text-box below, and then press the encrypt
            button.

            This is your encrypted information. Remember, this is designed to be
            very hard to reverse engineer and the only way to find out if it
            matches a certain string is to encrypt that string and check if the
            hash matches.

          Polynomials provide a fast and secure way to encrypt data. They
          involve simple math functions that most computers can perform at very
          high speeds. The duplicate rate is also very low. This means if I
          hashed one string using this method the probability of another hashed
          string having the same value is very low. Polynomial encryption is
          used by big companies such as Microsoft and Cisco. Polynomial
          encryption is also very easy to implement. code.<br /><br />
          Polynomials provide a simple form of hashing. Hashing is an encryption
          technique that revolves around the principle of irreversibility. This
          means if you are only given the processed hash of a password (or other
          sensitive information), it will be very hard to discover the original
          password. In fact, the only way to decrypt the password would be to
          hash a random string and then see if the hash matches the hash that
          you are trying to decrypt. However, if you are the company, you simply
          hash the user's password as they put it in, and check if it matches
          the hash in your database. This way, if a hacker gets access to your
          database, they still will be unlikely to get access to most of your
          user's passwords.<br /><br />

          hope you enjoyed my presentation!
